    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we use your personal information</h2>

    <p>
        The Environment Agency, Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), Northern Ireland
        Environment Agency (NIEA) and Natural Resources Wales (known as ‘environmental
        regulators’) run the WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) Online service. The
        environmental regulator that receives your data is the data controller for your personal data.
        A data controller determines how and why personal data (personal information) is
        processed.  Each environmental regulator has their own policy explaining your rights and
        how they deal with your personal information:
