<p>
    The Environment Agency, Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), Northern Ireland
    Environment Agency (NIEA) and Natural Resources Wales (known as ‘environmental
    regulators’) run the WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) Online service. The
    environmental regulator that receives your data is the data controller for your personal data.
    A data controller determines how and why personal data (personal information) is
    processed.  Each environmental regulator has their own policy explaining your rights and
    how they deal with your personal information:
